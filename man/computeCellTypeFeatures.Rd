\title{Compute cell type specific features}
\usage{
computeCellTypeFeatures(metaData, cores, sequencing, tpmfile, features_generic)
}
\arguments{
\item{metaData}{Dataframe indicating the paths to the ChIP-seq experiments.
More information on the format here \code{crupR::normalize()}}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to compute the CRUP score features}

\item{file}{Path to a file with gene and enhancer pairs.}

\item{tpmpath}{Path to a file with the RNA-seq TPM values, with the names of
the genes given as ENSEMBLE ID's}
}
\value{
A table containting the following computed features :
\itemize{
\item CRUP enhancer score for enhancer region, promoter region and the region
between the enhancer and the promoter
\item CRUP promoter score for enhancer region, promoter region and the region
between the enhancer and the promoter
\item RNA-seq TPM values
}
}
\description{
Computes the cell type specific features needed for the CENTRE classification
step.
